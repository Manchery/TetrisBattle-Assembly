## Introduction

Tetris game, supporting single player mode and multiplayer online battle, with funny items, implemented using *the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)*.

Course project for Principles of Assembly and Compilation, instructed by [Prof. Wang](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~wangchaokun/).

For details, see our report and slides (in Chinese).

## Development Environment

- IDE: Visual Studio 2019
- Assembler: MASM32
- OS: Win10.
## Run

Run `exe/tetris.exe` to start the game. You can choose single player or multiplayer mode in the game. If you start the game in multiplayer mode, please make sure the server is started first. When operating in the game, please turn off Chinese input or capitalization, otherwise the program cannot respond to keyboard events.

Run `exe/server.exe` to start the server. Please make sure that port `10086` is not occupied before running the server. The clock graphic is only for verifying that the server is not blocking with no other usage.

Single player, no need to connect to server.

Game operations:

- Left and right keys to control the movement of the pieces,
- Up keys to control the rotation of the pieces,
- Down keys to accelerate the fall of the pieces, 
- 1, 2, 3 keys to use the corresponding items. 

Game items: 

- To destroy the bottom three rows
- To slow down
- To skip the next block

A one-time elimination of $n$ rows, will give $n-1$ items, with random types. At the beginning of the game, one random item will be given.
